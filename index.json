I originally created this website using Twitter Bootstrap. However, I later decided to rebuild it with Hugo, a platform that I had never worked with before. But to be honest, I now truly appreciate its capabilities :).\nHugo has made it incredibly easy for me to create, manage, and publish content like what you are seeing here.\nHow I deploy the site? In my infrastructure, I have two Git repositories. The first one, ‚Äúpersonal_website,‚Äù contains all the Hugo code required to build the site. The second one, ‚ÄúPamilator.github.io,‚Äù receives the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù folder generated during the build, which represents the actual website. I deliberately separated the code from the result, and for now, it‚Äôs sufficient for my needs.\nFeel free to check out my repositories:\nPamilator.github.io personal_website Not much more to say for now, but I‚Äôm considering purchasing a fancy domain name, something like cedricfamin.me. Stay tuned for updates! üòÑ\n","date":1690062460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690062460,"objectID":"1c2a5dd8f04c087f5316de50fdf179f0","permalink":"https://pamilator.github.io/project/website/","publishdate":"2023-07-22T23:47:40+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/website/","section":"project","summary":"Check how I made this website using Hugo.","tags":[],"title":"My Website","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Premier post de mon blog personel.
